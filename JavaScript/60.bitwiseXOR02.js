let a = 14;  // Binary representation 1110 
let b = 18;  // Binary representation 10010 
  
console.log(a ^= b);
// The number 14 is represented as 1110 in binary, and the number 18 is represented as 10010 in binary. when the XOR assignment is performed 11100 is returned which conversion to decimal is 28.
